# NLP Project
our project is doing BERT visualization and interpret. Our work is based on
paper ["How contextual are contextu-alized word representations?
comparing the geom-etry of BERT, ELMo, and GPT-2 embeddings"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00512)
Our work will further use this to understand BERT, understand problem of 'anisotropy' and
also validate how to build a better BERT.
